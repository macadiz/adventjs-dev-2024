### My Adventjs.dev submissions

For every day there is a directory, inside the directory you may find the following structure:
```
|_ solution.ts         # Contains the solution submitted
|_ index.ts            # An index file to run some examples about the challenge
|_ README.md           # The challenge statement
|_ package.json        # Package file for dependency and run commands
|_ package-lock.json   # Lock file... Duh
```

If you want to run certain challenge just do:
```sh
cd <day>
#E.g: cd 1

npm install

npm run start
```
